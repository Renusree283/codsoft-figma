This repository contains my beginner-level UI/UX design task completed during the CodSoft internship.
The design was created using Figma, focusing on clean layout and user-friendly interface principles.
It demonstrates my foundational skills in wireframing and visual design.
You can find the live Figma design link and preview screenshots in this repo.
